# Counter Physical Design Project (RTL to GDSII)

## Overview
This project demonstrates the complete **ASIC Physical Design flow** for a simple **4-bit counter**, starting from RTL design to final GDSII layout.  
The flow covers:
- RTL design and simulation
- Synthesis to gate-level netlist
- Gate-level verification
- Place & Route (P&R)
- Timing analysis and optimization
- Final GDSII generation ready for tape-out

## Project Flow

1. **RTL Design**
   - Developed a **4-bit synchronous counter** in Verilog.
   - Verified RTL functionality using **Cadence NCLaunch** with a self-checking testbench.
   - Generated simulation waveforms for functional verification.

2. **Synthesis**
   - Used **Synopsys Design Compiler** to synthesize RTL into a **gate-level netlist**.
   - Mapped the design to a standard cell library.
   - Generated synthesis reports for **timing, area, and power**.

3. **Gate-Level Netlist Viewing**
   - Opened synthesized netlist in **Design Vision** for visualization and verification.
   - Verified proper cell instantiation and net connectivity.

4. **Floorplanning**
   - Defined core and die area.
   - Created power/ground rings and IO pin placements.

5. **Placement**
   - Placed standard cells using **Cadence Innovus**.
   - Performed legalization and cell density optimization.

6. **Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)**
   - Inserted clock buffers to balance skew and meet timing.

7. **Routing**
   - Routed signal nets, clock nets, and power distribution.
   - Checked for **DRC violations** and ensured clean routing.

8. **Timing Analysis**
   - Performed **Static Timing Analysis (STA)** for setup and hold times.
   - Ensured design meets target frequency with no timing violations.

9. **GDSII Export**
   - Generated final **GDSII layout** using **Cadence Innovus**.
   - Ready for fabrication.
